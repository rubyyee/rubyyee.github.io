Hello! I'm a PhD candidate studying physical oceanography at Dalhousie University.

I am broadly interested in turbulent mixing and diffusive processes in the ocean, and how research in these areas can be applied to solve real-world problems. My current work focuses on
the role of mixing in ocean alkalinity enhancement, a proposed method for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,
through the use of observations and numerical models.

<strong>I am currently seeking employment opportunities for fall 2026.</strong>
