I am a PhD candidate at Dalhousie University, where I have worked since 2021 with <a href="https://mixing.phys.ocean.dal.ca/">Ruth Musgrave</a> on a mixed bag of 
mixing-related physical oceanography projects (check 
them out [here](/projects/)). In my research, I use a mix of observations and numerical models (from highly idealized to realistic) to address questions that largely focus on 
the fate of "stuff"---such as heat, dye, and carbon---in coastal 
settings. I am excited by applications of physical oceanography to the field of marine carbon dioxide removal, where an understanding of tracer transport and dilution is critical for 
rigorous monitoring and verification. I am also passionate about science communication and exploring ways to share my science with wider audiences 
beyond academia.

Prior to my PhD, I completed a short stint as a research assistant working with both <a href="https://mixing.phys.ocean.dal.ca/">Ruth Musgrave</a>
(on an Arctic Ocean turbulence dataset) and <a href="https://ecjoliver.weebly.com/">Eric Oliver</a> (on a data recovery project in northern Labrador). I completed my undergrad at 
McMaster University 
in the Integrated Science program, concentrating in physics. My honours project was supervised by <a href="https://www.robinzhao.com">Robin Zhao</a>. In the summers during undergrad, I 
worked 
in search and 
rescue for the Canadian Coast Guard's Inshore Rescue Boat program on the Great Lakes.
