<h2>Dye tracer experiments at Tufts Cove</h2>
To gain insight about water mass transport, mixing, and dilution in Halifax
Harbour, several dye tracer releases were performed using fluorescent Rhodamine dye released
from an outfall pipe at Tufts Cove. Using measurements obtained from underway profiling with
sensors that measure fluorescence, we can construct transects of dye concentration to
understand how properties like stratification and tide phase affect the spatial distribution of
the dye. The motivation for this work is related to ocean alkalinity enhancement: alkalinity
releases are currently being conducted by the company <a
href="https://www.planetarytech.com/">Planetary
Technologies</a> at Tufts Cove for the purpose of carbon dioxide removal. Unlike alkalinity, the dye is easy to measure in-situ
using fluorometers, so we can make inferences about how alkalinity concentrations
evolve---important for assessing environmental impact, and efficiency of carbon dioxide
removal---based on the dilution rates measured using the dye.
		These experiments were conducted through collaboration across multiple research
groups, including the <a href="https://www.dal.ca/diff/cerc.html">CERC.Ocean group</a>, the <a
href="https://memg.ocean.dal.ca/index.html">Marine Environmental Monitoring group</a>, and the <a
href="https://mixing.phys.ocean.dal.ca/">Dalhousie Ocean Dynamics Group</a>. <br>

<h2>Numerical model of the Halifax Harbour estuary</h2>
Using the <a href="https://getm.eu/">General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM)</a>, I worked with
colleagues at the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research to develop a realistic local model
for Halifax Harbour and Bedford Basin. This model was initialized and validated against the
observational measurements obtained during our monthly surveys and during the dye release
experiments, and forced at the boundaries using output from the <a
href="https://memg.ocean.dal.ca/index.html">Marine Environmental Monitoring group</a>'s larger-domain ROMS model. In GETM, we can
simulate passive tracer release from Tufts Cove. Using modelling data, we are able to perform
analyses that are not possible at the spatial and temporal resolution of the observations from
the dye experiments (e.g., calculating the total amount of tracer in the domain and estimating
detectable surface areas over several weeks).

<h2>Idealized model of lateral dilution for Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE)</h2>
Due to the nonlinear relationship between total alkalinity (TA) and pCO_2,  an increase in TA 
when TA is already high will yield a minimal decrease in pCO_2, while an increase in TA when TA 
starts low will yield a much larger decrease in pCO_2. As a result, the rate of carbon dioxide 
removal (CDR) will differ depending on the dilution of a plume. For a fixed addition of 
alkalinity, a more laterally-dilute plume will flux faster than a less laterally-diluted plume. 
I am working on a series of idealized 2D MATLAB models to illustrate this phenomenon. The big 
open question here is, "under what circumstances does the nonlinear TA-pCO_2 relationship 
matter for CDR?"

<h2>Turbulence observations in the Arctic Ocean from temperature microstructure</h2>
 During a 2018 research cruise in the Arctic Ocean's Canada Basin, measurements of very
small-scale temperature were obtained using a fast-sampling instrument (Rockland's
MicroRider-1000) attached to a lowered CTD rosette. Using these measurements, I estimated
turbulent parameters like the dissipation rate of temperature variance, and the turbulent
diffusivity of temperature. A large part of this project was also focused on fine-tuning
rejection criteria for these kinds of microscale temperature observations.

We were able to quantify heat fluxes between different water masses in the Arctic
Ocean at the study site. The key results of this work were:

 <div class="projects-list">

- Average turbulent temperature diffusivity is elevated by 1–2 orders of
magnitude on the shelf compared to over the deep slope
- A similar magnitude of O(1 W/m^2) of heat is fluxed into the cold halocline
from the Atlantic Water below as from the overlying surface layer
- Heat fluxes as high as 50 Wm 2 are occasionally observed in the surface layer

<h2>Monthly transects in Halifax Harbour/Bedford Basin</h2>
Our group has been conducting monthly transect surveys in Bedford Basin and Halifax Harbour since
2021. This is a very dynamic estuary: the temperature-salinity structure can change dramatically
between months due to sporadic intrusions of dense water from outside of the estuary, and large
seasonal temperature changes on the order of ∆T~30degC are possible, and salinity can vary by tens
of g/kg depending on recent freshwater discharge.
