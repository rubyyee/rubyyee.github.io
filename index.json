[{"content":" Dye tracer experiments at Tufts Cove To gain insight about water mass transport, mixing, and dilution in Halifax Harbour, several dye tracer releases were performed using fluorescent Rhodamine dye released from an outfall pipe at Tufts Cove. Using measurements obtained from underway profiling with sensors that measure fluorescence, we can construct transects of dye concentration to understand how properties like stratification and tide phase affect the spatial distribution of the dye. The motivation for this work is related to ocean alkalinity enhancement: alkalinity releases are currently being conducted by the company Planetary Technologies at Tufts Cove for the purpose of carbon dioxide removal. Unlike alkalinity, the dye is easy to measure in-situ using fluorometers, so we can make inferences about how alkalinity concentrations evolve \u0026mdash important for assessing environmental impact, and efficiency of carbon dioxide removal \u0026mdash based on the dilution rates measured using the dye. These experiments were conducted through collaboration across multiple research groups, including the CERC.Ocean group, the Marine Environmental Monitoring group, and the Dalhousie Ocean Dynamics Group. Check out some CBC coverage on the dye release experiments, and more generally on OAE. A map of the Halifax Harbour-Bedford Basin study site.

This model was initialized and validated against the observational measurements obtained during our monthly surveys and during the dye release experiments, and forced at the boundaries using output from the Marine Environmental Monitoring group's larger-domain ROMS model. In GETM, we can simulate passive tracer release from Tufts Cove. Using modelling data, we are able to perform analyses that are not possible at the spatial and temporal resolution of the observations from the dye experiments (e.g., calculating the total amount of tracer in the domain and estimating detectable surface areas over several weeks).

As a result, the rate of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will differ depending on the dilution of a plume. For a fixed addition of alkalinity, a more laterally-dilute plume will flux faster than a less laterally-diluted plume. I am working on a series of idealized 2D MATLAB models to illustrate this phenomenon. The big open question here is, \"under what circumstances does the nonlinear TA-pCO_2 relationship matter for CDR?\" Turbulence observations in the Arctic Ocean from temperature microstructure During a 2018 research cruise in the Arctic Ocean's Canada Basin, measurements of very small-scale temperature were obtained using a fast-sampling instrument (Rockland's MicroRider-1000) attached to a lowered CTD rosette. Using these measurements, I estimated turbulent parameters like the dissipation rate of temperature variance, and the turbulent diffusivity of temperature. A large part of this project was also focused on fine-tuning rejection criteria for these kinds of microscale temperature observations. We were able to quantify heat fluxes between different water masses in the Arctic Ocean at the study site. The key results of this work were:\nAverage turbulent temperature diffusivity is elevated by 1–2 orders of magnitude on the shelf compared to over the deep slope A similar magnitude of O(1 W/m^2) of heat is fluxed into the cold halocline from the Atlantic Water below as from the overlying surface layer Heat fluxes as high as 50 Wm 2 are occasionally observed in the surface layer Read the published article here.\nTransects of turbulent temperature diffusivity at the shelf and shelfbreak.\nMonthly transects in Halifax Harbour/Bedford Basin Our group has been conducting monthly transect surveys in Bedford Basin and Halifax Harbour since 2021. This is a very dynamic estuary: the temperature-salinity structure can change dramatically between months due to sporadic intrusions of dense water from outside of the estuary, and large seasonal temperature changes on the order of ∆T~30degC are possible, and salinity can vary by tens of g/kg depending on recent freshwater discharge.

In my research, I use a mix of observations and numerical models (from highly idealized to realistic) to address questions that largely focus on the fate of \u0026ldquo;stuff\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;such as heat, dye, and carbon\u0026mdash;in coastal settings. I am excited by applications of physical oceanography to the field of marine carbon dioxide removal, where an understanding of tracer transport and dilution is critical for rigorous monitoring and verification. I am also passionate about science communication and exploring ways to share my science with wider audiences beyond academia.\nPrior to my PhD, I completed a short stint as a research assistant working with both Ruth Musgrave (on an Arctic Ocean turbulence dataset) and Eric Oliver (on a data recovery project in northern Labrador). I completed my undergrad at McMaster University in the Integrated Science program, concentrating in physics. My honours project was supervised by Robin Zhao. In the summers during undergrad, I worked in search and rescue for the Canadian Coast Guard\u0026rsquo;s Inshore Rescue Boat program on the Great Lakes.\nPlease reach out if you are interested in my work or would like to collaborate: r.yee@dal.ca!\n","permalink":"https://rubyyee.github.io/about/","title":"About"}]
